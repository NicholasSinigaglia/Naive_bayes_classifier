# Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier

This project is realized by Manara Noemi, Simionato Giuseppe, and me. It is a part of "Advanced statistics for physics analysis" course exam, by prof. Garfagnini Alberto

The goal of this project is to implement a Multinomial Naive Bayes in R language and test its performance in the classification task of social media posts. The Naive Bayes classifier is a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on the Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features (from this assumptions comes the name naive). Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic learning method that is mostly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The algorithm is based on predicts the tag of a text such as a piece of email or newspaper article: it calculates the probability of each tag for a given sample and then gives the tag with the highest probability as output.
